"""
Union Find / Disjoint Set
- To begin using Union Find, first construct bijection (For array based union find)
    - Bijection: Mapping between your object and the integers in the range [0, n) where n = length of your input
- At first, every value is a root node
- Path compression is what give Union Find amortized constant time Î±(n)
- Path compression happens during a find operation AND union operations
- We lazily do path compression, so It only applies to the nodes which we unify.
